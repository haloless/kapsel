To generate the KAPSEL guide you will need

- doxygen: source code documentaton system
  @http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

- latex or pdflatex: a type-setting system
  @http://ctan.org/
  If you don't have pdflatex unset the pdflatex flag in Doxyfile.in
     USE_PDFLATEX = NO

- graphviz dot tool: tool to generate directed graphs [optional]
  @http://www.graphviz.org/
  If you don't have the dot tool unset the dot flag in Doxyfile.in
     HAVE_DOT = NO

When ready, simply type
$ Doxygen Doxyfile.in
...this will take a while...
You should have two new directories for the html and latex documentations

1. html guide : 
   $    open html/index.html
2. latex guide:
   $    cd latex
   $    make
   $    open refman.pdf
